This is my first daily message, posted in the afternoon rather than the morning. In the future, all fo these will be posted when I wake up.

Let's do some about me.
I use nixos with limine, ly, xmonad, qutebrowser, and nvf on the day-to-day. I program in haskell, elm, nix, and rust. Functional programming for the win! My vps is also nixos, and it's so convenient to share my home-manager config between the two!

### Links
