I am packed! My checked bag initially weighed in at (yikes!) 60 pounds, but, with my stepmother's insight that 'they have books in German in Germany', I managed to cut down to just under 44 pounds.

How time flies - I had an appointment at 1300 and next thing you know it's 2330 and I haven't even done my vocabulary. My goodness - luckily I have 'midnight' set to 4 in the morning on my vocabulary app. I have 4 hours yet! Two of my good friends just left my house for the last time in this episode of our lives. I'm literally crying, I'm going to miss everyone so much. I hope I make friends as chill in Germany, just playing games and good music late into the night.

I got a haircut! It has *layers*, so I look more tasteful now. The shortest layer is just long enough to tuck behind my ear and the longest are just a touch shorter than what I had before - just enough to get the dead ends off. I need to get a good night's sleep tonight, tomorrow is going to be a long day.

The time I spend with family, friends, and educators means more to me than I can even express. This is going to be a long journey but I know I am strong enough.
