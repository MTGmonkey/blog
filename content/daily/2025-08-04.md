I need to work to make this as much a habit s journaling is. I need to pack today. I think I have everything in line, but one can never be too sure.

I'm nervous. I need to perform very well and I don't know if I ~~can~~ will. I know my family and friends will miss me... this journey has to be 'worth it,' in a way, to justify my extended absence.

On the agenda today:

- Write up and send an email to family, friends, and educators about this blog and the scholarship as a whole
- Create recipe cards for all of my favourite recipes so I can make them there
- Actually pack everything into my bag (to make sure it's under 44lb)
- Have 2 different friends over

I'm also having a couple of friends over for dinner tomorrow, the last dinner in my house before I leave it.

Have a wonderful rest of your day,

~Andromeda <3
